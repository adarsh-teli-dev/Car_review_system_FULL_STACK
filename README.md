# 🚗 Car Review System (MERN Stack)

A full-stack web application built using the **MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)** stack that allows users to explore, add, and review cars.  
Users can register, log in, rate cars, and leave reviews — similar to how IMDb or Yelp handles user reviews but focused on automobiles.


## 🚀 Overview
The **Car Review System** helps users:
- Browse through a list of cars.
- View detailed car specifications.
- Read user reviews and average ratings.
- Add their own reviews and ratings.
- Create and manage personal profiles.

The project demonstrates CRUD operations, authentication, RESTful API design, and frontend integration using React.
